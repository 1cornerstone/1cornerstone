### Mobile App Dev Experience:
Using Flutter :

	Thanks to Google for giving us this framework, i love it and it have become part of me. 

		1. With my years of experience i came to notice that there are something Project Manager/ UI&UX Designer / Developer should know. designing may be easy but there is one thing we dont count and it matter

			- Typography : During design stage ,Designer used to use font that feel okay for him/her without considering if developer can get that exact font to use in designing the mobile interface, i hereby indulge anybody reading this, pls alway tell UI/UX designer to always check Google font site and check the available font, doing this will bring what you design perfectly come through.
